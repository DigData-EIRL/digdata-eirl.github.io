## Introduction

This documentation is made with Markdown and GitHub Pages using Jekyll Theme Cayman.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the [digdata-eirl.github.io](https://github.com/DigData-EIRL/digdata-eirl.github.io) repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature, fix or improvement.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to `develop` branch.

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.

This allow us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Pull requests

All pull requests SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

Conventional Commits use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as main versioning workflow.

## Commits Style Guide

The contribution guideline is derived from [ConventionalCommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

## Keep your Fork updated

When you have the Fork repository cloned on your PC, the first thing you have to do is create a remote to `DigData-EIRL/digdata-eirl.github.io` using: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/DigData-EIRL/digdata-eirl.github.io.git` (You only have to do this the first time you clone the repository).

Then every time a change is made in `DigData-EIRL/digdata-eirl.github.io` and you want to bring it to your fork use the following commands:

1. `git pull upstream develop`
2. `git push`

**Note:** remember to be located within the branch you wanna update.

As a good practice, it is always recommended to execute these two commands before starting to work, _(just in case there is any change)_:

1. `git pull upstream develop`
2. `gil pull`
